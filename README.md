It seems like there's an extra backtick (\`) at the end of the file, which is causing the formatting issue. To fix that, simply remove the backtick at the end of your file (after the last "Contact" section).

Hereâ€™s the corrected version without the extra backtick:

## Setup

Follow these steps to get the application running locally without Docker:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ahmedkhnunar/Translation-Management-API.git
   cd Translation-Management-API
   ```

2. Install PHP dependencies with Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Copy the example environment file and generate an application key:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

4. Run database migrations and seeders:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

5. Serve the application locally:

## Docker Setup

To run the application using Docker for easier environment setup:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t translation-api .
   ```

2. Run the container exposing port 8000:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 translation-api
   ```

3. Run migrations and seeders inside the running container:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

   Replace `<CONTAINER_ID>` with the actual container ID from `docker ps`.
